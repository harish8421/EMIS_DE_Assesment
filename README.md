# EMIS_DE_Assesment

This is a task given by EMIS data engineering team to Harish as part of evaluation process for the position of data engineer

The task includes having an outside vendor use the FHIR standard to transfer patient data to our platform. 
Making dashboards and visualizations in this format is proving to be challenging for us. We are converting these 
FHIR messages into a more usable format, ideally in the form of a tabular format like CSV.
